Python scripts to do Geertsma/van Opstal based calculations
===========================================================

Folder			Purpose
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
py_opstal			Python script library
py_utils			Some (generic) utilities for the calculations
input_data			Input data
scripts			Some python scripts that do something useful (these use 'py_opstal')
working			'Live' folder (contains lots of garbage as well as useful stuff)

Relative folder locations are used in the scripts (see py_nlog_config.json), 
so should not be changed
